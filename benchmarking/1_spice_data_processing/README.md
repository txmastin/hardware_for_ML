# Phase 1: Python Post-Processing of SPICE Output

This phase focuses on creating a robust Python script to parse the raw data generated by ngspice (`output_data.txt`). This script will be responsible for:

- Loading the time-series data (Membrane Potential `V(Vm)`, Schmitt Trigger output `V(Vcomp_out)`, input current `I(Iin)`, and reset current `I(Mreset)`).
- Accurately detecting spike events from the `V(Vcomp_out)` signal.
- Calculating the neuron's firing rate.
- Estimating the energy consumed per spike based on current measurements.

This script will be a core utility, used by all subsequent benchmarking phases to extract metrics from simulation results.

## Contents:

- `spice_analyzer.py`: The Python script for data loading, spike detection, and metric calculation.
- `README.md`: This file, detailing the steps and purpose.
- `example_output_data.txt`: A sample `output_data.txt` (you can generate this by running a single ngspice simulation from `0_project_setup` manually).

## Key Steps:

1.  Create the `spice_analyzer.py` script.
2.  Implement functions for loading data, spike detection, and metric calculation.
3.  Test the script with a sample `output_data.txt` file.
