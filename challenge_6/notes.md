This code implements a simple perceptron trained to model the NAND logical function using a sigmoid activation function. The network consists of two input nodes connected to a single output. During training, the perceptron computes a weighted sum of the inputs, applies the sigmoid function to produce a smooth output between 0 and 1, and adjusts its weights and bias using gradient descent based on the difference between the predicted output and the true target. The gradient for the update is calculated using the derivative of the sigmoid function. After training over many epochs, the perceptron learns weights that produce high outputs (near 1) for inputs [0,0], [0,1], and [1,0], and a low output (near 0) for [1,1], matching the behavior of the NAND gate.

Regarding 2.b: it is a well known issue that a single perceptron is incapable of learning the XOR function, at a bare minimum one would need two perceptrons (or in general a multilevel perceptron model).
