# Iterating, Iterating, Iterating

Trying to get good performance from the spice model. Attempted many different iterations. The issue right now seems to be in the sharp discontinuity in the spiking output being too hard for spice to computationally handle. I have experimented with various continuous transitions, but my limited knowledge of spice is inhibiting any strong results. I will continue experimenting as I can.
